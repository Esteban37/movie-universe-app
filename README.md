# 🎬 Movie Universe
A Flutter application for discovering popular, top-rated, and searchable movies powered by The Movie Database (TMDB).

---

# 📖 Overview

Movie Universe is a Flutter application developed as a technical assessment.

The application allows users to browse, search and discover movies using **The Movie Database (TMDB)** API while demonstrating modern software engineering principles, scalable architecture and clean code practices.

The project follows a **Spec-Driven Development** approach using **Openspec**, where architecture, decisions, requirements and implementation tasks are defined as living specifications throughout the development lifecycle.

# 🌐 API

This application consumes data from:

**The Movie Database (TMDB)**

https://developer.themoviedb.org/

Authentication is performed using a Bearer Token generated from TMDB.

---

# 🔄 State Management

Riverpod is used as the application's state management solution.

# 🌍 Navigation

Navigation is managed using **Fluro**, providing centralized route management and better scalability.

---

# 🌐 Networking

Networking is implemented using **Dio**.

Features include:

- Interceptors
- Logging
- Timeouts
- Error Handling
- Retry Strategy

---

# ⚠ Error Handling

The application gracefully handles:

- No Internet Connection
- API Errors
- Timeout Exceptions
- Empty Responses
- Unexpected Exceptions

---

# 🧪 Testing

The testing strategy focuses on business logic.

Current coverage includes:

- Repository
- Providers
- Use Cases
- Data Mapping
- Search Logic
- Design-system widget tests
- List → detail navigation flow

Future coverage:

- Integration Tests
- Golden Tests

---

# ♿ Accessibility

Accessibility considerations include:

- Semantic widgets
- Dynamic text scaling
- Responsive layouts
- Screen reader compatibility

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.35.7+
- Dart 3.35.7+

---

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esteban37/movie-universe-app.git
```

Navigate to the project

```bash
cd movie-universe-app
```

Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Generate code

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Run the application

```bash
flutter run
```

---

# 🔐 Environment Configuration

Environment-specific source files live outside the bundle (gitignored):

- `.env.development` — local development (default)
- `.env.production` — release builds

Only **one** file is bundled in the app: `.env`. Copy the target environment before running or building:

```bash
# Development
cp .env.development.example .env.development
cp .env.development .env
flutter run

# Production (CI or local release)
cp .env.production .env
flutter build apk --release
```

See `.env.example` for all supported variables (`APP_ENV`, `TMDB_BASE_URL`, etc.).

> Secrets are excluded from the repository. CI should generate `.env` from pipeline secrets before `flutter build`.

---

# 📝 Assumptions

- Internet connection is required.
- A valid TMDB API token is required.
- API rate limits are managed by TMDB.
- The project prioritizes scalability over rapid implementation.
